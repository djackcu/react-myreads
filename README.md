# MyReads Project

This project was created with [REACT](https://reactjs.org/) as part of  [Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

##User instructions

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`
* Open [Local server](http://localhost:3000/) in the browser

### What You're Getting

A page that shows 3 shelves for books, and each book is shown on the their shelf `Currently reading` , `Read` and `Want to read`.
Each book shows a control that allows users to move it between shelves.
The main page contains a link to the search page. When the link is clicked, the search page is displayed and can search books to add on shelf.



## Backend Server

A backend server is provided in [Backend Server](https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com )

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
